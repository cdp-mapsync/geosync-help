Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge currently provide the best support for the web app on Windows and Mac OS. Both browsers use a similar installation process. First, navigate to the site you wish to install. There will be an icon on the right side of the URL bar. Click the icon, then click the "Install" button. Alternatively, you can install the web app from the "three dot" icon.

On a Windows PC, the web app will be available in the Start menu. On a Mac, the web app will be in the launcher and in the spotlight search.

Clicking the install button on these browsers will automatically install the web app.
