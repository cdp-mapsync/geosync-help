### I. Purpose

This policy establishes the **mandatory protocol** for utility partners utilizing our application to secure explicit customer consent for receiving electronic notifications. This is essential to ensure **regulatory compliance**, safeguard **customer privacy**, and maintain effective communication integrity.

### II. Scope

This policy applies to all utility companies and their agents who wish to use our application's services to dispatch automated or system-generated customer notifications, alerts, or reminders (e.g., outage updates, billing notices).

### III. Policy Requirements

Utility partners are required to execute a formal, auditable opt-in workflow as follows:

1.  **Request for Explicit Consent:** The utility must proactively initiate contact with customers to request **explicit, affirmative opt-in consent** for the delivery of notifications. The communication must clearly state the purpose and general types of messages the customer will receive.
2.  **Flexible Communication Channels:** The utility may leverage any combination of existing customer contact channels to solicit this consent. Approved channels include, but are not limited to:
    * **SMS/Text Message**
    * **Dedicated Email Communication**
    * **Direct Telephone Outreach**
    * **Formal In-Person/Paper Sign-up Verification**
3.  **Customer Record Flagging:** Upon the successful receipt of **verifiable customer consent**, the utility partner must immediately and accurately update the corresponding customer record in their database (which integrates with our application). This action must activate the mandatory **Notification Opt-in Flag**.

### IV. Compliance Mandate

Our application will only process and deliver automated notifications to customer records where the **Notification Opt-in Flag** has been set to **TRUE** by the utility partner. Utilities bear full responsibility for the accurate and lawful acquisition of customer consent and the maintenance of this critical flag. Failure to adhere to this protocol may result in the suspension of notification services.
