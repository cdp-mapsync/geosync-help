For data collected in GeoSync Go Plus to QGIS...the process in AM Tools called GPS2GIS of appending field-collected data in Go Plus into the master SQLite layer in QGIS.       NOTE: Don't forget to publish layers after the data has been appended to the master layers - so the updated master GIS layers get published back to field devices.
