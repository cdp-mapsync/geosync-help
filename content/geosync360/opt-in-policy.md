CDP-MapSync acts as the secure communication facilitator between utility companies and their customers. Our text notification service is governed by the customer lists provided directly by the utility.

Recipients on these lists have previously **opted-in** to receive time-sensitive alerts (e.g., service outages, demand response events, planned meter work) in accordance with the **Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA)**.

Crucially, notifications considered **service-critical**—which are non-marketing communications directly related to the provision of the utility service—**do not require separate, additional consent** under the TCPA.

All additions to the recipient list are strictly managed by the utility companies, which are responsible for collecting the necessary customer contact information.

### Opt-Out & List Management


If a utility company determines that a customer should no longer receive text notifications, their number can be removed from the active customer list upon the utility's request.
