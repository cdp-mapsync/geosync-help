Using GIS Tools... SQL connection information must already be setup.  This is usually provided as a Z-Tools project.

* From the Cloud/GIS Import Tab - refresh the GeoSync Cloud SQL layers
* Check the layers you want to download and click the To Master button. This will download to a local project folder and convert the data into a SQLite layer
* From the Master Layers tab refresh the local layers - you can preview the data if you want
* From the Layer Tools tab - refresh the layers in the list.  Check the layers you want to export and use the Export Layers tool from the toolbox to export.

Export Formats... GeoJSON (By Default), SHP, FileGDB, KML
