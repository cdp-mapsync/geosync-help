### Connect to your SQL workflow database

You will need to know the name of the database in order to download a pre-configured connection using the retrieve backup tool.

The video walks you through setting up the connection - retrieving a list of workflow tables - downloading a workflow to your local project.

Importing a layer to the master layer folder downloads a csv file of your data and creates an SQLITE layer allowing for local viewing and editing.
