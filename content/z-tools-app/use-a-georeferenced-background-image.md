title: "Use a Georeferenced Background Image"
---

You can add a georeferenced image as a background map in Z-Tools.  Use the Build XYZ Tiles to create tiles of a geotif image.  You can then add these tiles as a background map layer.  If you have a JPG with a world file you will need to convert the image to a geotif before making XYZ tiles.  The video provides an overview of the process.
