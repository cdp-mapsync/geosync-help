title: Update to Fix USGS Server Connection
---
			
USGS LIDAR servers have recently been down but are largely back working now.   USGS  took down their FTP server access to over 4 million tiles of data and now only allow access through HTTPS.  There is an update available for GeoSync Z-Tools - this update changes the download engine to use HTTPS instead of FTP - should work the same as before.
